## Structure

guie: Frontend Next.js app

## Branches

- development -> dev branch
- main -> it's the main branch
- prod -> our production branch so leave this alone

## Contributions

Virtual Board is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other. Also make sure to use the main branch!

## Virtual Board Reviewers

Contributors helping to review/merge pull requests:

## Why did you make this?

It is our dream to create a tool for daily usage with our school activities, it is highly inspired from BenAwad's DogeHouse. But we also want this to be a learning experience for the team!

## Investors

If you are interested in investing in Virtual Board or know someone we should talk to, send me an email at byronspringer.snt@gmail.com .
